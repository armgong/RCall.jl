# RCall.jl

[R](http://www.r-project.org) is a language for statistical computing and
graphics that has been around for couple of decades and it has one of the
most impressive collections of scientific and statistical packages of any
environment. Recently, the [Julia](http://julialang.org) language has
become an attractive alternative because it provides the remarkable
performance of a low-level language without sacrificing the readability
and ease-of-use of high-level languages. However, Julia still lacks the
depth and scale of the R package environment.

This package, [RCall](http://github.com/JuliaStats/RCall.jl), facilitates
communication between these two languages and allows the user to call R
packages from within Julia, providing the best of both worlds.
Additionally, this is a pure Julia package so it is portable and easy to
use.
